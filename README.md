# Server
Attached is my sample code for a Http Server that will accept up to 10 multiple request simulationsly.

You can download the jar file from the "store/" directory.

The program can be run with the following command "java -jar Server.jar"

You have the option of passing a single argument to the program to specify the port (ie. java -jar Server.jar 6000"
Note: if no port is specified, the default port is 6175

The program life file is generated in the directory that it is run from
